## Features

- **Search for weather by city name**: Type a city name and see the current weather.
- **Auto-suggestions**: As you type a city name, suggestions will appear based on the input.
- **Geolocation-based weather**: The app can fetch weather data based on your current location.
- **Error handling**: Displays error messages if there are issues with the API or user input.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **WeatherAPI**: A weather data API to get current weather information.
- **Geolocation API**: Used to fetch weather data based on user's current location.

## Getting Started

### 3. Set up your WeatherAPI key:

- Sign up for an API key at [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

  `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/search.json?key=YOUR_API_KEY&q=${query}`
);
```

### 4. Start the development server:
